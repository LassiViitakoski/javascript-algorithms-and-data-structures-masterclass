# Selection Sort

- Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position

### Selection Sort Pseudocode

- Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
- Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
- If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
- If the "minimum is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values
- Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

- My Solution

```javascript
const selectionSort = arr => {
  const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
  };

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let min = i;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[min]) min = j;
    }

    if (min !== i) swap(arr, i, min);
  }

  return arr;
};
```

### When to use Selection Sort?

- Selection Sort is good if we want for some reason to minimize number of swaps.
