# Data Structures Introduction

### What do data structures do?

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

### Why so many?

- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### Why care?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!
